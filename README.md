This repository provides a customized [.devcontainer](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) setup, designed for use with [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and GitHub Codespaces.

## Overview

This repository is a rework from the original [devcontainers](https://github.com/devcontainers) project, and it utilizes:

- [**devcontainer templates**](https://github.com/devcontainers/templates): Dev Container Templates
- [**devcontainer features**](https://github.com/devcontainers/features): collection of Dev Container Features
- [**devcontainer images**](https://github.com/devcontainers/images): pre-built dev container images

The **`src`** folder contains customizations and configurations that layer on top of these resources.
